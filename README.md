### [Boolean approach to signalling pathway modelling in HGF-induced keratinocyte migration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22962472/) 
Cell migration is a complex process that is controlled
through the time-sequential feedback regulation of protein signalling
and gene regulation. Based on prior knowledge and own
experimental data, we developed a large-scale dynamic network
describing the onset and maintenance of hepatocyte growth factor-
induced migration of primary human keratinocytes. We applied
Boolean logic to capture the qualitative behaviour as well as short-
and long-term dynamics of the complex signalling network involved
in this process, comprising protein signalling, gene regulation and
autocrine feedback. A Boolean model has been compiled from time-resolved
transcriptome data and literature mining, incorporating the main
pathways involved in migration from initial stimulation to phenotype
progress. Steady-state analysis under different inhibition and
stimulation conditions of known key molecules reproduces existing
data and predicts novel interactions based on our own experiments.
Model simulations highlight for the first time the necessity of a
temporal sequence of initial, transient MET receptor (met proto-
oncogene, hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and subsequent,
continuous epidermal growth factor/integrin signalling to trigger and
sustain migration by autocrine signalling that is integrated through
the Focal adhesion kinase protein. We predicted in silico and verified
in vitro that long-term cell migration is stopped if any of the two
feedback loops are inhibited.

### [Boolean modeling reveals the necessity of transcriptional regulation for bistability in PC12 cell differentiation](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2016.00044/full)

The nerve growth factor NGF has been shown to cause cell fate decisions toward either differentiation or proliferation depending on the relative activity of downstream pERK, pAKT, or pJNK signaling. However, how these protein signals are translated into and fed back from transcriptional activity to complete cellular differentiation over a time span of hours to days is still an open question. Comparing the time-resolved transcriptome response of NGF- or EGF-stimulated PC12 cells over 24 h in combination with protein and phenotype data we inferred a dynamic Boolean model capturing the temporal sequence of protein signaling, transcriptional response and subsequent autocrine feedback. Network topology was optimized by fitting the model to time-resolved transcriptome data under MEK, PI3K, or JNK inhibition. The integrated model confirmed the parallel use of MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, and JNK/JUN for PC12 cell differentiation. Redundancy of cell signaling is demonstrated from the inhibition of the different MAPK pathways. As suggested in silico and confirmed in vitro, differentiation was substantially suppressed under JNK inhibition, yet delayed only under MEK/ERK inhibition. Most importantly, we found that positive transcriptional feedback induces bistability in the cell fate switch. De novo gene expression was necessary to activate autocrine feedback that caused Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator (uPA) Receptor signaling to perpetuate the MAPK activity, finally resulting in the expression of late, differentiation related genes. Thus, the cellular decision toward differentiation depends on the establishment of a transcriptome-induced positive feedback between protein signaling and gene expression thereby constituting a robust control between proliferation and differentiation
